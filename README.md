Repository for DS 4002 project 1.

## Section 1: Software and Platform Selection
We used the Python language for all analysis and it was run on a local enviroment through Anacdonda and the code was wrote in VS code.
For additional software we imported the python packages pandas, transformers, and json.
We used Windows as our platform.

#### Section 3: Instructions for Reproducing Results
1. Navigate to the DATA folder and download the file software_5.json.
2. Upload software_5 file into whatever enviroment you use (e.g. Google Colab or VS Code)
3. After uploading the file, navigate to the SCRIPTS folder and upload the preprocessing1.ipynb file to the enviroment as well.
4. After uploading, run the script and wait for it to complete processing.
5. After running the preprocessing script, navigate once again to the SCRIPTS folder.
6. There you will see the the file called modelrunning2.ipynb.
7. Download and then upload this file to the same enviorment you have the data file uploaded to and that you ran the preprocessing script on.
8. After you upload, run the script modelrunning2.ipynb. WARNING: this can take a long time to run on all rows of the file
